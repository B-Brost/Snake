# Snake


This is a Python-based Snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food (orange squares) on a grid. The snake grows longer and faster with each food consumed, 
and the game ends if the snake hits the grid walls or its self.

Instructions
Starting the Game: Run the Python script to start the game. The snake starts at the center of the grid.
Controls: Use the ‘w’, ‘a’, ‘s’, and ‘d’ keys to control the direction of the snake. ‘w’ moves the snake up, ‘a’ moves it left, ‘s’ moves it down, and ‘d’ moves it right.
Eating Food: Navigate the snake to the food (orange squares) to eat it. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and a new piece of food appears at a random location on the grid.
Game Over: The game ends when the snake crashes into the wall or into its own body.
Scoring: The score is determined by the length of the snake. The longer the snake, the higher the score.
